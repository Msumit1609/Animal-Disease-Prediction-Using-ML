## Animal Disease Prediction Model

**Project Overview**

The Animal Disease Prediction Model is a machine learning-based system that helps predict potential diseases in animals using health-related data such as symptoms, 
age, and other vital parameters. The system leverages classification algorithms to provide accurate predictions and assist in early disease detection.To enhance accessibility, 
the model is integrated with a Streamlit-based web interface that allows users to interact with the system in real time. The application also includes a secure authentication 
system (login/registration), ensuring that only authorized users can access the platform and its prediction services.
